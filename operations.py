# # types of operands
# # s,t: a signed number
# # bit: either 0 or 1
# # byte: byte-valued - a value between 0 or 255
# # var: a variable number ie 0 for the top of the routine stack, 1-15 for local, 
# # and 16-255 for global variables. It is an error if this operand is not byte valued
# # baddr: a byte address
# # raddr: a packed address referring to a routine
# # saddr: a packed address referring to a string
# # obj: a legal object number
# # attr: a legal attribute number
# # prop: a legal property number, or 0 for the get_next_prop instruction
# # window: a legal window number, or a special negative value. In the v4+ erase_window
# # and the v6 mouse_window instructions -1 means the entire screen. in v6 -2 means the
# # entire screen for an erase_window. in v6 -3 is always interpreted as the current 
# # window.
# # time: any non-zero number, in multiples of 0.1s. it is unspecified what happens when
# # this is zero, recommended behaviour is to behave as if no time operand has been given
# # pic: a legal picture number. note that the legality of picture numbers can be 
# # checked using the picture_data instr.
# # 
# # it is an error if another value is given for one of the above operands
