zmachine in python
The Z-machine was created on a coffee table in Pittsburgh in 1979. It is an imaginary computer whose programs are adventure games, and is well-adapted to its task, implementing complex games remarkably compactly. They were still perhaps 100K long, too large for the memory of the home computers of their day, and the Z-machine seems to have made the first usage of virtual memory on a microcomputer. Further ahead of its time was the ability to efficiently save and restore the entire execution state.

The design's cardinal principle is that any game is 100% portable to different computers: that is, any legal program exactly determines its behaviour. This portability is largely made possible by a willingness to constrain maximum as well as minimum levels of performance (for instance, dynamic memory allocation is impossible).

Infocom's catalogue continues to be sold and to be played under interpreter programs, either original Infocom ones or more recent and generally better freeware ones. About 130 story files compiled by Infocom's compiler Zilch survive and since 1993 very many more story files have been created with the Inform design system. 

This is a very rudimentary implementation of the z-machine that does not support pictures, audio, or save files

Installation:
Place z-machine games in the games folder
